You have checked out the master branch from the Git repository. That
was a mistake.

This branch is under heavy refactoring. Nothing will work. It might
not even compile, on any platform.

If you want a functioning MIDI sequencer, check out the branch
Branch_0_2 instead, or get the latest release from
http://dino.nongnu.org.
