is playing (and recording).

 [X] Creating and deleting tracks
 [/] Changing track properties (label, MIDI port, MIDI channel)
 [X] Creating and deleting patterns
 [ ] Changing pattern properties (label, length, note resolution, CC resolution)
 [/] Editing note events in patterns
 [\] Editing CC and pitch bend events in patterns
 [X] Arrange patterns
 [\] Add, edit, and delete tempo changes
 [/] Play MIDI note events
 [X] Loading and saving files
 [X] Support for CCA events Save_File, Restore_File, and Quit
 [ ] Play MIDI CC and pitch bend events

Later:

 [ ] Record MIDI note events
 [ ] Record MIDI CC and pitch bend events
 [ ] Play loops, set loop points
 [ ] Edit the song and control the sequencer with OSC commands
