To install Dino with the default configuration, just type 'make install' as 
root. 

If you want to change the installation directory, compiler flags, or
other options, or if you don't have a 'Makefile.config' (probably because
you downloaded the code from the version control system), run 'configure'
first to generate 'Makefile.config'. Any parameters on the form 
'--VARIABLE=VALUE' that you pass to the 'configure' script will set the 
Makefile variable VARIABLE to the value VALUE. You can use this to change 
the installation directory 
('configure --prefix=/my/new/installation/directory'), set non-standard 
compiler flags ('configure --CFLAGS="-DNDEBUG -O6"'), or any other Makefile
variable you want to change. You can pass as many parameters to configure as 
you want, and every time you run it the old configuration will be completely
overwritten.

For example, if you want to build Dino without debugging information and
install it to /home/ll/software you could run the following commands:

  configure --CFLAGS=-DNDEBUG --prefix=/home/ll/software
  make
  make install

Note that the configure script is _not_ like the scripts generated by autoconf -
it will not check that you have all packages you need in order to build Dino,
that is done in the Makefile. The configure script _only_ sets Makefile 
variables, and only the variables you give it on the command line.
