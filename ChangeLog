Version 0.2.4 (2010-02-10):
	* Fixed bug with missing <cstdio> header (reported by Harry Van Haaren)

Version 0.2.3 (2010-01-30)
	* Updated to latest JACK API (MIDI functions)
	* Fixed some code errors detected by GCC 4.3 and later
	* Fixed namespace collisions in track.cpp
	* Fixed bug caused by JACK transport ABI change (transport struct
	  is now packed, can't take reference to members)
	* Added configure check for libsigc++ >= 2.0.18 (patch by
	  Dennis Prochko)
	* Fixed include path bug in src/gui/Makefile that broke
	  make distcheck

Version 0.2.2 (2006-10-10)
	* Added namespace prefix Pango:: in a couple of places to avoid
	  ambiguity (Pango::Layout vs Gtk::Layout) that stopped the
	  compilation, reported by nedko on #lad

Version 0.2.1 (2006-05-17)
	* Added #include <cassert> in noteevent.hpp (reported by
	  Apage43 on #lad)
	* Bumped the JACK requirement to version 0.102.5, which is available
	  in anonymous CVS and has MIDI support - no more patching needed!
	* Fixed a rather embarrassing timestamping bug that forced all events
	  to happen on JACK period boundaries, adding lots of jitter at large
	  period sizes

Version 0.2.0 (2006-05-06):
	* First release
