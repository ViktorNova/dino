Version 0.2.2 (2006-10-10)
	* Added namespace prefix Pango:: in a couple of places to avoid 
	  ambiguity (Pango::Layout vs Gtk::Layout) that stopped the 
	  compilation, reported by nedko on #lad

Version 0.2.1 (2006-05-17)
	* Added #include <cassert> in noteevent.hpp (reported by
	  Apage43 on #lad)
	* Bumped the JACK requirement to version 0.102.5, which is available
	  in anonymous CVS and has MIDI support - no more patching needed!
	* Fixed a rather embarrassing timestamping bug that forced all events
	  to happen on JACK period boundaries, adding lots of jitter at large
	  period sizes
	
Version 0.2.0 (2006-05-06):
	* First release
